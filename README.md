# Chozordle

This is a clone project of the popular word guessing game we all know and love, using vocabulary from the Chozo language used in Metroid Dread. Made using React, Typescript, and Tailwind.

Source code was forked from [react-wordle](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle), and makes use of the fonts [Mawkin Sans](https://github.com/raffitz/mawkin-sans) and [Pixel Chozo](https://www.dafont.com/pixelchozo.font). A huge thanks to [Chozo Course](https://twitter.com/ChozoCourse) and everyone in the Cipher Club for decoding Chozo.
